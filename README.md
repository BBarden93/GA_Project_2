### Technology: 
* Ruby on Rails (version 2.5.0)
* Postgresql

###Technical Requirements

* Have at least 2 models (more if they make sense) â€“ one representing someone using your application, and at least one more that represents the main functional idea for your app.
* Include sign up/log in functionality, with authentication. Implement basic authorization by restricting access to certain features, such as editing and deleting a resource, to an authenticated user.
* Have complete RESTful routes for at least one of your resources with GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.
* Have full CRUD for at least one of your resources.
* Have semantically clean HTML and CSS.
* Be deployed online (Heroku) and accessible to the public.


### Approach:
